# client-dreamlancer

=======
The goal of Dreamlancer is to provide a one stop shop where clients can request and fulfill their projects with the help of freelance developer(s). Clients will be able to take small peeks as their project is built by their selected development team, a form of transparancy and accountability that is needed in the freelancing world! Developers will be able to update and provide a roadmap as development of a project continues, assuring that no misunderstandings happen along the development process.

## About
This app allows you to create, view, update, and delete technical project postings. You can also create a client or developer/contractor profile to bid or accept bids for projects. Lastly the app allows the developer/contractor to update their progress throughout production to allow the client to track their progress.
